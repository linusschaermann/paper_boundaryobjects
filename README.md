# Abstract

Effective collaboration across disciplinary boundaries is crucial yet challenging in information systems, especially with the increasing integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning. Boundary objects offer a valuable concept to understand how shared artifacts can facilitate such collaborations. This seminar paper presents a structured literature review, conducted following the guidelines proposed by Okoli, on the application of boundary object theory within information systems research, with a specific focus on the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The review reveals that boundary objects, which can range from mock-ups, prototypes, and data visualizations to artificial intelligence models themselves, are an essential part in enabling knowledge sharing, collaboration in complex environments, and bridging knowledge gaps among diverse stakeholders. In summary, the use of boundary objects in such systems enables effective planning, development and use of information systems and artificial intelligence/machine learning applications.
